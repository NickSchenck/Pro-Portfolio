        <h2>What you should know...</h2>
            <p>Well as you may have read, my name is Nick Schenck! I am an American developer, born in 1993 in Minnesota and have lived in the state all my life.
                Lover of the cold, outdoors, cooking and food, animals, and writing DnD characters. You'll often find me gaming, walking my pets, watching Youtube, chatting online, bulding
                 bonfires, and splitting wood. I have a penchant for very spicy foods, menacing my cat, and daily workouts. I've worked plenty of service and food jobs, about 11 years in fact,
                 but have always spent quite a bit of my time on computers, and wanted to work with them more and more over the past 7 years. Knowing that I would be able to develop the expertise
                 necessary to pursue my technical inclination if I repurposed my time spent online and on computers towards more structured work, I decided to enroll in a certification program
                 through the University of Minnesota.
